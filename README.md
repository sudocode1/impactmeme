# impactmeme
make impact font memes because apparently theyre still funny

## how it works
you are asked for top text, bottom text, an image name and a font color and then the image will be created. if there are any errors they will be sent back to you.

## parameters
eg. `node index.js --larger` <br>
<br>
`--larger` - double the size of the canvas and the text <br>
`--largertext` - double the size of text <br>
`--largercanvas` - double size of canvas <br>
`--setvals <textSize> <canvasHeight> <canvasWidth>` - set custom values for the generator 

## stuff i need to do (feel free to contribute)
- text outline
- fix text placement with custom values (base of canvx + canvy, not just canvy)
- allow custom urls for images because people hate local shit
- become funny
